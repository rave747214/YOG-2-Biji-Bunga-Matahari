This is the repository for Assignment #05-First Machine Learning Project in Bangkit

In this work, we are trying to classify whether an online shopper would purchase a product or not, based on his/her behaviour on the website. We also want to know what are the most important factors that make customers decide to buy the product, so we can provide suggestions for e-commerce companies to increase the number of purchasing customer.

The data used for this analysis is collected from https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/online-shoppers-intention

From the analysis that we conducted, we can conclude that :
- Most of the customers ended up did not purchase anything. Only 15.49% of the customers ended up purchasing something
- The Dropout layer on the MLP architecture (Model 2) affect the model to perform better than the model that did not use Dropout layer

Then, the recommendation that we can give to the Online Shop stakeholder are follows

We know that most of the customers ended up did not purchase anything. To increase the proportion of purchasing customers, the online shop can give some promo or discount for some products or in specific times, like Black Friday, National Online Shopping day (Harbolnas in Indonesia), Holidays, etc. And also, we also know that most of the online shop customers are the returning visitor. From the recommendation above, we can also increase the customer loyalty (and make new customers) so the revenue for the online shop can be increased.
